    <h1>
      OK this is a pretty lazy update page, but it's 2:30 am so cut me some slack thanks.
    </h1>
    <h3>
      The update is focuses mainly on the client-side UI and API features.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The UI now includes these awesome dropdown menus: use enter to select the highlighted option, arrow keys to move the highlighted option, and it auto-suggests based on what you've already typed! Also, it's pretty unobtrusive, and you can completely manually type everything just like old times.
      Also, you can now use spaces after commas! This was the #1 issue people had and it was very easy to fix.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is now an actual API! GET <a href="/tournaments">/tournaments</a> lists tournaments on QuizBug 2, <a href="/categories">/categories</a> and <a href="/subcategories">/subcategories</a> do the same. GET <a href="/search">/search</a> with a query string, categories, subcategories, difficulties, tournaments, and search type (a/q/qa) returns the raw JSON QuizBug 2 uses to read questions!
    </p>
    <p>Sample search: <code>https://quizbug2.herokuapp.com/search?query=borodin&categories=Science, Fine Arts&subcategories=Science Chemistry, Fine Arts Auditory&difficulties=3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8&tournaments=2017, PACE NSC&searchType=qa</code></p>
    <h3>I hope this update makes QuizBug 2 more helpful and usable for you! Thanks for using it!</h3>
